# Sensu-Salt

Your source to use Sensu with SaltStack.

There is already a SaltStack Formula in the SaltStack community repository, [saltstack-formulas/sensu-formula](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/sensu-formula).

In addition, you may want to use the Formulas for [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/salt-formulas/salt-formula-rabbitmq) and [Redis](https://github.com/salt-formulas/salt-formula-redis).

## Legacy
This project's maintainers decided to start over due to the lack of recent maintenance. You can still pull the old code by checking out the following commit `69ea0682e86ebc0a2b3ce70dd13a7abddff3f0b8` available [here](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-salt/tree/69ea0682e86ebc0a2b3ce70dd13a7abddff3f0b8) or by going to the [`legacy` branch](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-salt/tree/legacy).
